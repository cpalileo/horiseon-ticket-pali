# Code Refactor Starter Code

Challenge 1 a marketing agency called Horiseon requested our services to bring their website up to accessibility standards.  This included various integrations such as implementing semantic HTML elements to the code and adding ALT descriptions to all images.  Additionally, I've made an attempt to reorganize the code, particularly in the CSS file, in a more systematic way that better reflects the order in which the the elements are presented on the website.  Additioinally, various notes where added to allow for others to better navigate the code.  

During this process I struggled with setting up a new GIT repository.  This is why there is not very many multiple versions of the repository committed in GITHUB.  The second commit is only updated to include this README.  However, future commits may be added in the future and documented here.
